1.Configuration Instructions
 
Equipment
•	Raspberry PI
•	External USB sound card 
•	Microphone, 3.5 mm headphone jack plug (further: mic)
•	RJ45 Cable 
•	Power supply cable
•	Main operating computer ( PUTTY )
Set Up
Check whether Curl library is already installed on the RPi by running the following command:
	
	~$ ls /usr/include/curl
	If it is not, install it by running the following commands:

	~$ sudo apt-get update
	~$ sudo apt-get install libcurl3
	~$ sudo apt-get install libcurl4-openssl-dev


	To install alsamixer:
	~$ sudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list
	Add the following line at the end of sources.list:
	
	Run:

	~$ sudo apt-get update
	~$ sudo apt-get install alsa-utils=1.0.25-4
	Reboot (if necessary).

	To test the sound quality:
	
	Run:

	~$ arecord -r44100 -c1 -f S16_LE -d5 test.wav
	Connect dynamic to the sound card. 
and to play ,Run:

	~$ aplay test.wav


	2.Installation Instructions

The installation of the program requires a screen and a HDMI cable connected to the screen. 

First we need to run Linux system and then change the default configuration by entering some codes. Afterwards, only raspberry Pi and Ethernet cable should be connected to computer. Then the installation is completed.

3.Operating Instructions

The user simply runs putty and enter IP address that is sent to user's computer(If the email is not sent, the user may check the information on the website www.cc.puv.fi/~gc/php/rasp.php). Then open appdev file which contains the source code. After that, operate application by typing "./sound.a"(remember to change the Remote Character Set as UTF-8). It should shows many vertical bars on the screen.
